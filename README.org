#+title: WPS office for linux 2016 local intaller
#+author: Entropy (bmsac0001@gmail.ocm)

This repo maintained the obsolete [[https://www.wps.com/office/linux/][wps-for-linux]] 2016 edition since its
has less heavy resource requirements.

For install:

#+begin_src sh
bash install.sh --install
#+end_src

This will install the wps-for-linux_2016 in your home directory's
=.local= folder (i.e. the standard XDG_DATA_HOME parent place) so that
it doesn't pollute your system package syste.

Use ~the --uninstall~ option to uninstall as so.

There's no requirements needed to run the executable installed by this
repo since the old wps-for-linus 2016 edition use the obsolete QT4
library and maintained internally with =LD_LIBRARY_PATH= pre-defined
in its caller. So, it's out of box.
